# Arctic Tours

This project will be a fictional blog about tourism in the Arctic. The blog features elegant colour choices and should appeal to those that seek an high-end experience in the exotic sub arctic. All the pictures are from different creators on Unsplash.com . The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices. A Wordpress REST API was established to fetch the blog posts. A working contact form with JS validation was added.
